libmodule-build-perl (0.360100-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Please note that the Module::Build::Compat 'passthrough' style is
  now considered deprecated (see the docs for Module::Build::Compat
  for details).

  As well, the prepare_metadata() API has been made deprecated; it
  may be made private or disappear in a subsequent release.
